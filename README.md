## Project Description
Our project aims to personalize the learning experience for students by providing them with a platform to choose the courses they are interested in, and assigning them a mentor to guide them through the learning process. The platform also allows trainers to add courses based on their specialization, which are then displayed to students who can register for any course they choose.

The platform has four types of users: students, mentors, trainers, and administrators. Each mentor is assigned a group of students, and they are responsible for monitoring their progress on the platform. Administrators oversee the platform's operation, ensuring that everything runs smoothly.

Key Considerations
To ensure the success of our project, we have taken the following considerations into account:

User Experience: The platform should be easy to use and navigate for all users, with clear instructions on how to use it.

Personalization: The platform should allow students to choose courses that match their interests and abilities, and assign them a mentor who can guide them through the learning process.

Monitoring: Mentors should be responsible for monitoring the progress of their assigned students, ensuring they are making progress and meeting their goals.

We believe that our platform will provide students with a personalized learning experience that will help them achieve their educational goals.
